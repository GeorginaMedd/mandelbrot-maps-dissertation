        Benoit Mandelbrot (1924 - 2010) was a French-American mathematician who due to his
        access to IBM computers, was able to discover the Mandelbrot set in 1980 while he
        worked there. He eventually left IBM when they ended reserach in his division, and
        moved onto work in the Mathematics department at Yale University.

        can be split into two disjoint sets, such as set A and B containing the numbers
        (1,2) and (3,4,5) respectively. A and B are disjoint sets as they have no elements
